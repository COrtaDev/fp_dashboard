Welcome to the ReadMe

## Outline

The Athnos Dashboard is a project for CMP-239

The site (so far...) is build using Reactjs and Bulma-React Components

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Bulma Components](https://react-bulma.dev/en/storybook)

Other steps to come are the dashboard widgets adding funtionality to the site.

Currently, the project is using the built in Bulma stylings. Custom styling will be implemented in the coming weeks.

The project to this point has consisted of developing a working prototype as a proof of concept.
